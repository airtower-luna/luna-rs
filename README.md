# LUNA in Rust

Luna-rs is a re-implementation of [LUNA (Lightweight Universal Network
Analyzer)](https://github.com/airtower-luna/luna) in Rust. The
original tool was my graduation thesis project, the re-implementation
is primarily Rust practice. The packet format is compatible, the
output format is different (still tab separated values, but different
columns, now unified between client and server).
